You can use the slider to define the amount of coding experience you have, and lastly press the "introduce self" button to display the completed introduction alert.

### App Walk-though

`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walk-though `gif` in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README.
